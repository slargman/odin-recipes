# Recipes for Odin

 My version of the [Recipe Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) in The Odin Project

## Description

The Recipe Project is the first project in The Odin Project's Foundations course. In particular it tests the ability to make a basic website using HTML. A later [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/css-foundations#practice) in the CSS foundations section directs the learner to style the Recipe page at their discretion.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Organize a website into a file structure and link between the different components of the structure (i.e. pages and images)

* Use correct format for an HTML page (i.e. html, head, body elements)

* Structure content using headings and paragraph elements
